            . At release, anyone could claim million pixel for just gas. Each pixel contains a coordinate (x, y).
          </p>
          <p>
            Million is an unaudited project. Pixels #200001 to #999999 were claimable by
            anyone and #0 to #200000 are currently reserved for the contract
            deployer.

          <h3>How do I value million nft?</h3>
          <p>
          They say that value is always in the eye of the beholder. Million is no different, with no explicit rarities specified at launch. How you value a million nft is up to you.
          </p>
          <p>
          Still, the community has begun to devise many mechanisms by which to assess the rarity of million and their items. Some of these include the position of pixel.
          </p>
          <p>Remember, use your own discretion when valuing a million nft.</p>
